        <h1>What is FBI?</h1>
        <p>
            The FBI is an intelligence-driven and threat-focused national security organization with both intelligence
            and law
            enforcement responsibilities. It is the principal investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Justice and a
            full
            member of the U.S. Intelligence Community. The FBI has the authority and responsibility to investigate
            specific
            crimes assigned to it and to provide other law enforcement agencies with cooperative services, such as
            fingerprint
            identification, laboratory examinations, and training. The FBI also gathers, shares, and analyzes
            intelligence,
            both to support its own investigations and those of its partners and to better understand and combat the
            security
            threats facing the United States.
